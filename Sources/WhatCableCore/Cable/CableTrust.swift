/// it. Carries no user-facing copy (that arrives in the UI phase, the same
/// way `DataLinkDiagnostic` deferred its wording).
///
/// **Behaviour-first model** (see `planning/cable-trust-model.md`). Trust is
/// whether the cable *delivers what it claims*, not whether its e-marker bits
/// are internally tidy. Running the static-flag model against the real cable
/// corpus showed that spec-encoding flags fire on genuine hardware (Apple's
/// own cables among them), so those flags are **notes only** here; they never
/// set the tier.
///
/// **Phase 1 (this type) produces green or amber only.**
/// - Green: we have *watched the cable deliver its claim* (the live link
///   carried its claimed speed, or a PD contract carried its full rated
///   power). Earns green even with a zeroed vendor ID: performance outranks
///   pedigree. Registration alone is **not** enough, because green is a claim
///   of proof and registration isn't proof of delivery.
/// - Amber: unverified. Nothing demanding has been connected, or the maker
///   can't be corroborated. Not a fault, never "suspicious."
///
/// Red ("isn't performing as expected") is Phase 2: it needs attributed,
/// *corroborated* non-delivery (repeat failure or overcurrent), which depends
/// on session-quality monitoring. This type never emits red yet.
